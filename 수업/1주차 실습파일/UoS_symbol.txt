The symbol of the University of Seoul takes its motif from the letter 'S', the symbol of yin and, yang and the symbolic form of Korea. 
The S form is combined with a dark-to-light chiaroscuro to create a spatial structure. 
The caressing curves on the left and right express the energy towards 'Man, City, and Future.' 
The force pushing outside symbolises the progressive spirit and unending growth of the university.
